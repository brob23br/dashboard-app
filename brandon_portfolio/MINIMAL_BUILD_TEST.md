# ðŸš€ MINIMAL BUILD TEST

This is a test deployment with minimal components to verify the build process works.

**Changes Made:**
- Simplified `page.tsx` to basic HTML
- Simplified `layout.tsx` to remove theme provider dependency
- This should allow the build to complete successfully

**Next Steps After Successful Build:**
1. Gradually add back components one by one
2. Fix any import/export issues
3. Restore full functionality

**Timestamp:** $(date)

If this build succeeds, we know the core infrastructure is working and can focus on component-specific issues.
