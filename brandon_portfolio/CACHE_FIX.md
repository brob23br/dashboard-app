# ðŸš¨ VERCEL CACHE ISSUE FIX

## The Problem
You're getting this error even though:
- âœ… Environment variables are set correctly in Vercel
- âœ… Root directory is set correctly
- âœ… No `@strava_client_id` references exist in your code

This suggests **Vercel is using cached configuration** from a previous deployment.

## ðŸ”§ IMMEDIATE SOLUTIONS

### Solution 1: Force Fresh Deployment
1. **Make a small change to trigger new deployment:**
   - Add a comment to any file (like `package.json`)
   - Or add a space to `README.md`
2. **Commit and push the change**
3. **This forces Vercel to rebuild from scratch**

### Solution 2: Clear Build Cache
1. **Go to Vercel Dashboard** â†’ Your Project
2. **Go to Settings** â†’ **Functions**
3. **Look for "Clear Build Cache"** option and click it
4. **Then redeploy**

### Solution 3: Delete and Recreate Deployment
1. **Go to Deployments tab**
2. **Delete the failed deployment**
3. **Push a new commit to trigger fresh deployment**

### Solution 4: Recreate Project (Last Resort)
If nothing else works:
1. **Delete the Vercel project**
2. **Re-import from GitHub**
3. **Set root directory to `brandon_portfolio`**
4. **Add environment variables again**

## ðŸŽ¯ Quick Test Change
Let me add a comment to package.json to trigger a fresh deployment:
